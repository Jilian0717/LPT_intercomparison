# LPT_intercomparison

In this study, we evaluated five ocean particle tracking software packages that can work with ROMS hydrodynamics outputs, including:

    LTRANS: https://northweb.hpl.umces.edu/LTRANS.htm
    OpenDrift: https://opendrift.github.io/
    Particulator: https://github.com/neilbanas/particulator
    ROMS online floats:
    Tracker: https://github.com/parkermac/LO/tree/v1.1/tracker

This repository includes example codes and [zenodo]() directory linked to the hydrodynamic outputs from our Hood Canal model (built using ROMS).
