# LPT_intercomparison

In this study, we evaluated five ocean particle tracking software packages that can work with ROMS hydrodynamics outputs, including:

**Four offline particle tracking:**
  
    • LTRANS (Fortran): https://northweb.hpl.umces.edu/LTRANS.htm
    • OpenDrift (Python): https://opendrift.github.io/
    • Particulator (MATLAB): https://github.com/neilbanas/particulator
    • Tracker (Python): https://github.com/parkermac/LO/tree/v1.1/tracker
**One online particle tracking:**

    • ROMS online floats (Fortran): https://www.myroms.org/wiki/floats.in   
#
This repository includes example codes for each tracking packages and [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/10208175) link to the hydrodynamic outputs from our Hood Canal model (built using ROMS).
